# Record Collection

## Project Description

Record Collection is an app that aims to catalog and organize a user's record collection. A user can input a record into the database, fill out information like artist, title, tracklist amongst other related fields.

Once the records are in the database, the user can search and retrieve them and their information in an intuitive, easy to use interface.

The app will be built using Django with REST Framework and PostgreSQL for the backend and React for the frontend.
